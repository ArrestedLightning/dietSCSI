SCSI Twister
==========
Some SCSI-based machines (e.g. the Mac LC series) expect their hard drive to be mounted such that the 50-pin connector ends up reversed compared to what the dietSCSI board expects.  The SCSI Twister is a simple board that I designed to flip the SCSI connection around to make it easier to install the dietSCSI board in those machines.  After designing it, I decided that I would prefer not to introduce any additional boards if at all possible, and instead modified the case design to allow the board to be installed upside down.  I have never built this board, and can therefore make no promises as to its functionality.  It is included here for the sake of completeness only.
