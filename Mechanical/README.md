Cases
==================
Several 3D-printable case options are available for the dietSCSI.  Cases were designed using FreeCAD; all designs are in the same CAD file.  You will need 4 M3x5mm machine screws to attach the board to the case and hold on the lid.  The internal versions are also designed to use M3 screws for the mounting fasteners.

Portable
---------

This case is designed for external use.  It could also be used internally if mounted using velcro or adhesive tape.

3.5" Compact
--------

This case is designed for internal use.  It is smaller so it is printable on smaller printers.  Its size is more or less constrained by the standard 3.5" drive mounting holes.  This means that it will sit further in compared to a real hard drive.  If your SCSI cable is only just long enough for a standard drive, it may not work with this enclosure.  The standard SCSI cable included with a Macintosh Classic II is just barely long enough to reach when using this enclosure.  Mounting holes are available on both the sides and the bottom, allowing for mounting options that should work with most computers.

3.5" Extended
--------

This case is also designed for internal use.  It is designed to be closer to the size of a standard 3.5" drive, which means that the SCSI connector should come just about up to the edge.  This should be more compatible with more systems.  It is also designed so that it can be mounted upside down using either the side or the bottom mounting holes, which may be necessary to get the SCSI connector in the correct orientation.  In particular, this feature was designed with the Macintosh LC family in mind.  I have not tested this, though, so I can't guarantee it will fit.

Lids
--------

All of the above case designs use the same lid.  There are two lid options available, one with a cutout for the SCSI ribbon cable, and one without the cutout.  The cutout is suggested for most people, as it makes more functionality available to you, but if you are putting together a portable version and you are 100% sure that you will only ever be using the DB25 connector, the "without cutout" version does give a cleaner appearance.
